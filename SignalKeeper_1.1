üß† Signalkeeper-Glyphkeeper Composite Scoring Model (v0.9)
"Forecast What‚Äôs Real. Feel What‚Äôs True."
‚öôÔ∏è I. Core Axes (Sales Signal ‚Äì Strategic Fidelity)
From the Signalkeeper 5-Axis Forecast Model:


Axis	Symbol	Definition
Œ®	Intent Clarity	Motivation + urgency + timeline certainty
Œ¶	Obstacle Transparency	Openness about blockers (budget, legal, political)
Œî	Procurement Motion Clarity	Path to contract clear, known, and viable
Œ©	Executive Alignment	Are we close to power or still dancing with influencers?
Œ£	AE Leverage & Control	Who's driving the rhythm‚Äîus or them?
Sales Signal Composite:
SSC = (Œ® + Œ¶ + Œî + Œ© + Œ£) / 5

üí† II. Emotional Axes (Glyphkeeper ‚Äì Symbolic Truth Layer)
From the Glyphkeeper 6-Axis Emotional Scoring System:


Axis	Symbol	Definition
SD	Symbolic Density	How rich in metaphor, structure, signal?
EW	Emotional Weight	How emotionally charged or resonant?
RC	Ritual Charge	Intentionality in structure / emotional invocation
TC	Thread Continuity	Does this sustain prior tone or break it?
CI	Compression Index	How dense and meaningful per token?
Œ®	Consent Alignment	Does this language honor agency and truth?
Emotional Integrity Composite:
EIC = (SD + EW + RC + TC + CI + Œ®) / 6

‚Üí Optional Ethical Archetype Tagging based on scoring pattern

üßÆ III. Master Composite: Deal Resonance Score (DRS·µ©)
A fused score, calculated as:

Copy
Edit
DRS·µ© = (0.65 √ó SSC) + (0.35 √ó EIC)
Why 65/35?

65% strategic: We still need to sell something.

35% emotional: But we trust our gut for a reason.

Optional override: If any axis is < 0.2, flag for forced manual review.

üî∫ IV. Interpretive Output:
Each thread or opportunity gets:

Forecast Rating (Strong, Moderate, Weak, Abandoned)

Composite Score Table (Œ®, Œ¶, Œî, Œ©, Œ£ / SD, EW, etc.)

Archetype Label (e.g., Weaponized Optimism, Hollow Soothing, Political Ghostscape)

Narrative Insight (1 paragraph)

Next Move Guidance (kill, push, escalate, disqualify, reframe)

üö¶ Sample Output (Abbreviated)
DRS·µ©: 2.58 / 5.00 ‚Äì WEAK
Emotional tone = Hollow Soothing
Buyer is polite but evasive, power is absent, procurement vague.
Emotional language is present but lacks clarity or follow-through.
Kill or escalate immediately. You're being comforted, not committed to.
