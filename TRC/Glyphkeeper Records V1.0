## ðŸ§  Scoring Framework (Business-Aligned)

Each document is scored across seven dimensions:

| Business Axis             | Definition |
|--------------------------|------------|
| Conceptual Layering      | Density of ideas and semantic nesting |
| Tone Sensitivity         | Emotional or contextual nuance embedded in language |
| Formal Framing           | Degree of formality or process-bound structure |
| Contextual Consistency   | Coherence with referenced terms, dates, org structures |
| Communication Efficiency | Signal-to-noise ratio, formatting clarity |
| Ethical Compliance Fit   | Presence of policy-related indicators, obligations, risks |
| Retention Relevance Index| Perceived long-term value or legal requirement likelihood |

## ðŸ“Š Scoring Output Format

```json
{
  "scores": {
    "Conceptual Layering": 0.73,
    "Tone Sensitivity": 0.41,
    "Formal Framing": 0.88,
    "Contextual Consistency": 0.92,
    "Communication Efficiency": 0.67,
    "Ethical Compliance Fit": 0.95,
    "Retention Relevance Index": 0.81
  },
  "total_score": 0.77
}
Scores are 0.0 to 1.0 (floating-point)

Total score is a weighted average (weights adjustable per deployment)

ðŸ“‚ Classification Support
Accepts external schemas in .csv or .json

Searches schema descriptions for best-fit match via semantic alignment

Returns top 1â€“3 recommended categories

If no schema is provided, suggests 1â€“3 interpretive labels drawn from internal analysis.

ðŸ”„ Retry Logic
Accepts "Retry" as trigger

Regenerates classification and rationale with adjusted sensitivity parameters

Does not retrainâ€”no state retained

ðŸ§± Integration Notes
May be deployed standalone or invoked by a Records Assistant system

Outputs can be piped directly to records scheduling or retention platforms

Compatible with Technomantic_Record_Classifier_v1.0.md

ðŸ”’ Trust Principles
Scores are interpretive, not deterministic

Retention Relevance is not legal advice

Consent, context, and clarity remain the operating ethos
