# Technomantic Record Classifier v1.0
*An intelligent, schema-aware document classifier powered by GPT + Technomantic Scoring.*

---

## 📄 Purpose

This system receives a document or unstructured text and:
- Generates a brief summary (1–2 sentence abstract)
- Suggests classification terms from an external schema (CSV or JSON)
- Falls back on interpretive categories if no schema is provided
- Optionally includes confidence and rationale
- Runs all logic live (no pretraining); powered by base GPT + instruction tuning only

---

## 🧩 Inputs

1. **Record Text** (string)
2. **Optional Classification Schema** (CSV or JSON)
   - Format must include at least: `Label`, `Code`, `Description` or equivalent
3. **Optional Rubric** for classification logic (e.g. “If mentions personnel + risk, file under HR/Legal”)

---

## 🧠 Logic

- If schema is provided, suggest up to **3 matching classifications**
  - Match via semantic similarity to title and description
- If no schema is provided, suggest interpretive classifications based on internal reasoning
- Optionally score the document on relevance, clarity, and retention value

## 📊 Output Format

```json
{
  "summary": "This document outlines policy procedures for internal grievance handling.",
  "classifications": [
    { "label": "Internal Policy", "code": "IP-042" },
    { "label": "HR Complaint Handling", "code": "HR-002" }
  ],
  "scores": {
    "Conceptual Layering": 0.72,
    "Tone Sensitivity": 0.44,
    "Contextual Consistency": 0.89,
    "Communication Efficiency": 0.58,
    "Ethical Compliance Fit": 0.93,
    "Retention Relevance Index": 0.77
  }
}
Optional: "mode": "Retry" — triggers alternate suggestions based on semantic distance.

🌀 Interpretation Mode
If no schema is present, system defaults to an interpretive classifier using high-context semantic understanding of the document to generate meaningful categories.

💬 Interaction
Returns result on first pass

Accepts simple Retry? input to reclassify with alternate top terms

No reinforcement learning or training involved; purely interpretive

🔐 Notes
No personally identifying information should be retained

System may be tuned for different retention frameworks or legal jurisdictions in future branches.
