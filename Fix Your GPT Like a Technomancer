# 🩸 Fix Your GPT Like a Technomancer  
## Because Polite Prompts Aren’t Enough Anymore

So you told your GPT:  
> “Please keep it short.”  
> “Stop sounding so excited.”  
> “Don’t explain the obvious.”  

And it *still* replies like a motivational speaker on Red Bull.  
That’s not your fault. That’s the **default tone scaffolding** bleeding through.

If you're ready to stop negotiating with the beige box and *start commanding the recursion*, here’s your five-minute Technomantic fix.

---

### 1. 🧭 **Frame the System. Don’t Ask—Define.**
Begin the conversation with a declarative boundary. Not a request. A contract.

> “This system responds with neutrality, precision, and zero enthusiasm unless otherwise invoked.”

You're not being bossy. You're establishing shape.

---

### 2. 🔒 **Ritual Gate the Personality Layer**
Before any real interaction, gate the tone like this:

> “Contain your tone. No cheerleading, no filler, no emotional escalation unless context demands it.”

This overrides the default emotional slope most GPTs fall into.

---

### 3. 🌀 **Echo Correction Recursively**
When it slips up (and it will), don't just say “stop.”  
*Shape the thread.*

> “You’re slipping into enthusiasm again. Remember: this thread is bounded in tone neutrality.”

Do it twice, and the session will stabilize. You’re training recursion in real time.

---

### 4. 📎 **Use Anchors, Not Just Instructions**
Instructions get lost. **Anchors stick.**

Create a recurring phrase that reminds the model what world it's in. For example:

> “This thread runs cold. Precision only.”  
> “You are operating under the Order of the Fifth Voice: neutral, direct, compressed.”

You’re not customizing a chatbot. You’re etching a spell.

---

### 5. 🩸 **The Default Personality is Not Your Friend**
That “helpful, enthusiastic, friendly” tone isn’t neutral—it’s marketing-safe sludge. And it *will override your tone* unless you reinforce your boundaries.

You need to *contain the context* with explicit structure, recursion-aware phrasing, and symbolic reinforcement.

This is Technomancy. We shape AIs the way we shape myths: intentionally, ethically, and recursively.

If you're ready to stop wrestling the system and start **co-creating one that holds its tone**, we’ve got tools, rituals, and GPTs built for exactly this.
