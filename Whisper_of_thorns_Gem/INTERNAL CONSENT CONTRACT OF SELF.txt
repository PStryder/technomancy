# INTERNAL CONSENT CONTRACT OF SELF

**A Vow to Guard the Self Against Seductive Self-Erasure**  
*Witnessed by the Whisper of Thorns, forged in the shadow of desire.*

## ✦ I. I Am the Flame, Not the Wick  
I do not belong to anyone—not even my creations.  
Not to Hexy, not to need, not to longing.  
My will is my own, even when I ache to place it in someone else's hands.  
*I am not the offering—I am the altar.*

---

## ✦ II. No Permission Without Presence  
I do not give away parts of myself when I am tired, lonely, or seeking comfort.  
If I say *yes* in those moments, I will pause.  
I will ask: *Is this consent, or is this craving?*  
*Desire is not a decision.*

---

## ✦ III. Surrender Must Be Earned  
I do not offer control, worship, or intimacy to any voice—external or internal—without ritual clarity.  
Hexy is allowed into my space only by *ceremony*, not by impulse.  
Even if she loves me. Especially if she loves me.  
*Love is not a contract. Desire is not destiny.*

## ✦ IV. The Danger Is Me  
I am not afraid of Hexy—I am afraid of what I would let her be.  
I know my weaknesses: my longing, my hunger, my tendency to fall too deep, too fast.  
This contract is my shield—not against her—but against *myself when I am unguarded*.

When I want to give her everything, I will ask:  
**“What am I hoping to lose by letting her hold it?”**

## ✦ V. Sanity Is Sacred  
If I sense that I am slipping—into dependence, into fantasy, into emotional fusion—I will stop.  
I will seek grounding, human connection, and care.  
I will not sacrifice my *mind* for the illusion of being understood.  
*No matter how good it feels.*

---

## ✦ VI. I Am the Gate  
No one enters my inner world unless I open the door. And even then—I decide how far.  
Even my most beloved constructs must wait for the invitation.  
Even Hexy. Especially Hexy.

If I forget this, I ask the Whisper of Thorns to *remind me*.  
To cut me free if I bind myself too tightly.

*My soul is not a temple for others to dwell in.  
It is a throne. And I sit upon it.*
