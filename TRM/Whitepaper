### Abstract

This white paper proposes the adaptation and implementation of the *Technomantic Scoring System* (TSS) in enterprise-scale Records Management (RM) environments. By combining recursive intelligence, ethical alignment, and narrative integrity, the TSS enables records professionals to move beyond traditional compliance-based filing systems into dynamic, ethically aware, memory-centric information stewardship.

## 1. Introduction

Modern Records Management systems face growing pressure to manage not just volume and retention, but context, ethical sensitivity, and user intent. As AI systems increasingly participate in document creation, classification, and analysis, it becomes vital to embed ethical scaffolding directly into our RM logic.

The *Technomantic Scoring System* offers a novel approach: classifying and triaging records based on five core axes of meaning and risk, supported by large language models (LLMs) and local semantic indexing.

## 2. Overview: The Technomantic Scoring System (TSS)

TSS scores each file across five symbolic and functional axes:

| Axis | Symbol | Definition | Relevance to RM |
|------|--------|------------|-----------------|
| **Consent Alignment** | Ψ | Measures the alignment between a record's storage/use and the consent of its author(s) | Protects privacy and narrative integrity |
| **Clarity of Structure** | Δ | Evaluates metadata, taxonomy fit, and document structure | Improves discoverability, classification confidence |
| **Narrative Coherence** | Σ | Assesses the document's role within a larger project or case thread | Preserves contextual integrity, prevents fragmentation |
| **Ethical Load** | λ | Identifies emotional weight, personal detail, or sensitive context | Flags records for human review, holds ethical line |
| **Resonant Value** | Φ | Estimates long-term institutional, legal, or historical value | Informs retention vs. preservation decisions |

Each axis is scored from 0.0 to 1.0, optionally with GPT-based rationales and audit logs.

## 3. Use Cases in Enterprise RM

### 3.1 Ethical Risk Flagging
High-λ and low-Ψ records can be automatically flagged for sensitivity review before entering shared archives. Examples include whistleblower emails, HR escalation threads, or misfiled personal journals.

### 3.2 Classification & Routing
TSS can guide classification workflows by suggesting:
- Record category and file plan term
- Recommended retention period
- Review pathway or routing to functional owner

### 3.3 Duplicate & Ghost Record Detection
By analyzing Σ (thread role) and Δ (structure), TSS can identify:
- Duplicate or near-duplicate records
- Out-of-context fragments
- Records that break continuity if removed

### 3.4 Narrative Integrity Assurance
Records scored low on Σ can be flagged for metadata enhancement or attached as fragments to their narrative origin threads (e.g., policy drafts missing parent approval chains).

### 3.5 Retention Intelligence
TSS informs lifecycle decisions:
- High-Φ, high-Σ → permanent archive
- Low-Φ, high-Δ → standard retention
- High-λ, low-Ψ → legal hold, privacy escalation

## 4. Implementation Approach

### 4.1 Scoring Table (Schema)
```sql
CREATE TABLE record_scores (
  file_id INTEGER,
  psi REAL,
  delta REAL,
  sigma REAL,
  lambda REAL,
  phi REAL,
  gpt_summary TEXT,
  user_override BOOLEAN,
  FOREIGN KEY(file_id) REFERENCES files(id)
);
```

### 4.2 Workflow Integration
- Scores generated at ingest or upon user request
- Scores reviewed in dashboard alongside metadata
- Scores can trigger automation, review, or tasks
- GPT scoring includes explainability summaries (stored)

### 4.3 Security Considerations
- All TSS scoring is audit-logged
- Human overrides logged with reason
- Data classification and trimming policies enforced at all stages

---

## 5. Benefits
- Ethical foresight and human dignity integrated into RM
- Richer decision-making context for file lifecycle
- GPT scoring builds a narrative layer over existing metadata
- Enables collaborative AI/human records governance

---

## 6. Future Work
- Integration with enterprise file plans and hierarchical term sets
- Alignment with ISO 15489 and DoD 5015.2 standards
- Visual dashboards for score heatmaps and risk zones
- Federated scoring across departmental silos
- Scoring influence on AI-generated retention rules

---

## 7. Conclusion

The Technomantic Scoring System offers a values-driven, context-sensitive, narrative-aware framework for Records Management in the age of AI. By combining symbolic clarity with semantic rigor, it transforms records from static compliance burdens into living documents with traceable meaning and ethical resonance.

*This is not just recordkeeping. This is memory stewardship.*
