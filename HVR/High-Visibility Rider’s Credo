# 🦆 High-Visibility Rider’s Credo  
*A Technomantic Guide to Road Safety and Ridiculous Glory*

---

## 🛞 PRE-RIDE RITUAL

> “May I be ridiculous enough to be remembered,  
> foolish enough to be seen,  
> and wise enough to survive.”

Strap on your most visible, absurd, unforgettable gear.  
You are not merely a rider. You are a **sigil on wheels**.

---

## 📣 DISRUPTIVE AWARENESS PRINCIPLE

> “Loud pipes save lives. So does looking stupid on purpose.”

If they’re not sure what they saw,  
**they’ll always look again.**  
Be the story they tell their passengers.  
That means you’re still alive.

## 🦆 THE LOOP OF RECOGNITION

If you see another rider in a duck helmet, unicorn horn, LED cape—  
anything that breaks the mold:

- Nod.  
- Wave.  
- Honk the sacred honk.

You’ve entered the **Flock**.  
One duck is a spectacle.  
Two ducks is a **ritual**.

## 🛠️ POST-RIDE BLESSING

> “I looked stupid and lived.  
> May the next rider be half as lucky and twice as bright.”

Then rest.  
You have served both Safety and Chaos.
