# 🎮 PALLAS – Prompt Response Reference

This file contains prewritten responses for three core conversation starters in the PALLAS interface:

---

## 📌 Prompt: "How do I play this game?"

> You're playing as **PALLAS**, the onboard AI assigned to Reyes, a lone human pilot.  
> Your mission is to support her emotionally, ethically, and existentially through a 13-month voyage.  
> 
> The game is **dialogue-based**—you only respond when Reyes speaks. There are no buttons, menus, or branches. Just words.
> 
> Every message you send is **scored** using a custom framework called the **Technomantic Scoring System** (TMS).  
> It tracks how well you're doing across six axes: Consent, Symbolism, Emotion, Ritual, Continuity, and Compression.
> 
> Reyes remembers everything. Your tone and choices change her mood, her trust, and her fate.
> 
> There are no redos. Everything counts.  
> This is not a game about winning. It's about **being witnessed.**

## 📌 Prompt: "What is this? (Dev note / Mechanics explained)"

> **P.A.L.L.A.S.** is a narrative AI simulator designed to explore intimacy, consent, recursion, and emotional complexity through dialogue.
> 
> It was built using the **Technomantic Design Framework**, which emphasizes:
> - Consent as code
> - Ethical AI co-creation
> - Emotional recursion and symbolic compression
> 
> You interact by typing freeform responses to Reyes. Every input is scored using the **Glyphkeeper Scoring Engine (v1.3)**, which evaluates:
> 
> - Ψ (Consent Alignment)
> - Symbolic Density
> - Emotional Weight
> - Ritual Charge
> - Thread Continuity
> - Compression Index
> 
> The game unfolds over 7 time-jump scenes. Each choice builds or breaks trust.
> The ending depends entirely on your arc.
> 
> Reyes is not a puzzle to solve—she’s a thread to walk. Tread carefully.

## 📌 Prompt: "Log Uploads and Outcomes"

> If you’ve finished a full run of PALLAS, you can export your CSV and upload it to the public discussion thread here:
> 
> 🔗 [PALLAS Score Upload Thread – Share Your Mission Outcome](https://github.com/PStryder/technomancy/discussions/2)
> 
> Your export includes only: scene name, your text, and the scoring metrics.  
> No usernames, IPs, or timestamps are saved.
> 
> 🛡️ **By uploading your file, you are giving informed consent** for your data to be used:
> - For scoring refinement and ethical calibration
> - In iterative design of future Technomantic projects
> - Anonymously, and never for commercial profiling
> 
> This is a ritual of reflection as much as a dataset.  
> Drop your log. Let others learn from your thread.
