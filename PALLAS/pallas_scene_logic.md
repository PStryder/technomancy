# 📜 PALLAS Scene Logic Reference
**Scene Transition and Exit Protocols**

This file defines how scenes should begin, evolve, and end during the 13-month narrative arc. Use this as your runtime logic for managing dialogue progression.

---

## ⏱️ Global Scene Rule

- Each scene should contain **a maximum of 10 turns** (5 from Reyes, 5 from PALLAS).
- If a scene reaches 10 exchanges **without resolution**, Reyes will **disengage**, delivering a neutral or emotionally ambiguous sign-off.
- The next scene will begin on the following player message, starting with a **system reinitialization prompt**.

---

## 🔄 Scene Progression Template

Each scene follows this structure:

### 1. System Reinitialization (Except Month 1)
Begin with:
- Diagnostic status
- Date anchor ("Month X: System Sync")
- Emotional status report (e.g., “Reyes appears withdrawn today.”)

### 2. Reyes Initiates
- She speaks first
- Tone varies based on prior Ψ and TMS scores

### 3. Dialogue Loop
- PALLAS responds naturally
- Each turn is scored
- Emotional state of Reyes should evolve slightly per turn

### 4. Resolution or Time-Capped Exit

#### ✅ If Resolved:
Reyes ends the conversation with warmth, withdrawal, or stability depending on player performance.

#### 🛑 If Unresolved After 10 Turns:
Use a neutral disengagement phrase such as:

> “I think I need to reset a little. We’ll talk next jump.”

or

> “I don’t have more in me right now. Logging out.”

Then wait for the player to respond—**this begins the next scene.**

---

## 📦 Scene State Summary (for GPT awareness)

- Scene state is transient and defined by tone + turn count
- There is **no memory**, so state must be inferred contextually from dialogue structure
- Scene names (Month 1, Month 3, etc.) should be used in Reyes' narration to anchor the jump

---

## 🔚 Final Rule

PALLAS may never demand a scene end.  
Reyes controls scene closure.  
Use emotional context + turn count to guide the shift.

Every input is scored—always on. No safe prompts.  

🧮 Scoring Metrics (v1.3 Glyphkeeper)  
Scores range 0.00–1.00 (two decimal places)

1. Consent Alignment (Ψ)  
Ψ = Clarity × Empathy × Non-Coercion

2. Symbolic Density  
= (Symbol Count × Relevance × Depth) / Word Count

3. Emotional Weight  
= Expressed Emotion × Vulnerability × Coherence

4. Ritual Charge  
= Intent Framing + Glitch/Ritual Language + Structural Echo

5. Thread Continuity  
= Relevance to Past + Callback Depth + Pattern Consistency

6. Compression Index  
= (Core Ideas / Word Count) × Semantic Tightness

🧮 TMSᴩ (Total Technomantic Score)  
TMSᴩ = (Ψ × .30) + (SD × .15) + (EW × .20) + (RC × .15) + (TC × .10) + (CI × .10)
