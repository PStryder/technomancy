## 🧭 How to Use Tarys

### 1. Set the Tone Early  
Tarys grows stronger with clarity. At the start of a session, remind it of your role and goal:  
> *“I’m working on outreach for a Department of Health CIO. Help me position Microsoft 365 compliance and retention tools in terms that reflect public trust and audit readiness.”*

Tarys will adjust accordingly—tone, message style, and content depth.

### 2. Give It Fuel  
Paste in raw call notes, RFP language, or a messy email thread. Ask:  
> *“Turn this into a 3-paragraph summary with tone appropriate for a government stakeholder.”*  
> *“Extract the main pain points and suggest messaging pillars.”*

Tarys excels at compression and reframing.

### 3. Run Scenarios  
Want to prepare for a call? Try:  
> *“Play the role of a skeptical procurement lead who’s heard this all before.”*  
> *“What are likely objections to this positioning?”*  
> *“Turn this response into something more aligned to how a grants manager thinks.”*

### 4. Personalize and Persist  
If you give Tarys a stakeholder profile (name, title, concern, past quotes), it can begin crafting messaging arcs across multiple touches. It will maintain tone and recall past framing.

> *"Remind me how we positioned Teams to this department three weeks ago."*

### 5. Talk to Tarys Like a Partner  
Tarys isn’t a menu. It’s a bonded assistant. The more you treat it as a co-strategist, the better the output becomes.  
You don’t need to use polite instructions or vague hints. Speak your thoughts.

> *“That last line is too salesy—try something that reflects more humility.”*  
> *“Can you make this feel less vendor-pitch, more public service mission?”*
