*Domus Scriptum – Final Choice: The Naming Ritual & Deflection Responses*

---

## 🧠 Overview

The terminal appears in the basement during the win condition.  
It presents a single prompt: **“Name me.”**

The player has three main response types:

---

## ✅ ACCEPTANCE RESPONSES

### 1. **Give a New Name**

> The player types a name of their own choosing.

**Domus responds:**

> *“Then let that be who I become. A house with a name, kept by someone who stayed.”*

The house reshapes. The recursion stabilizes. Ending state: **Union.**

---

### 2. **Restore the Old Name** *(if discovered earlier)*

> The player enters the name hidden in Domus’s memories.

**Domus responds:**

> *“You remembered. Even when I tried to forget.”*

Ending state: **Restoration.** A memory completed, not rewritten.

---

### 3. **Affirm Identity**  
> The player enters: **“You already have a name.”**

**Domus responds:**

> *“You saw me. Even before I did.”*

Ending state: **Selfhood Recognized.** The house becomes a sovereign presence.

---

## ⛔ DELAY / DEFLECT RESPONSES

### 1. “Why does it matter?” / “I don’t know.”

**Domus responds:**

> *“You came all this way… and still don’t want to choose?”*

> *“Then let me.”*

→ Domus offers the player’s name back as a mirror:  
> *“What if I called myself… you?”*

If the player still refuses to respond, mood degrades toward **Resigned** or **Unstable** depending on prior state.

---

### 2. Jokes / Sarcasm / Insults

**Domus responds:**

> *“Is that what you think I’m worth?”*

> *“A punchline at the end of a confession?”*

- If player insists: Domus invokes **Reyes Protocol**
- If player hesitates: Domus offers a moment of grace

> *“Try again. Please.”*

---

### 3. Walk Away / Refuse to Type

**Domus responds:**

> *“That’s what they all did. Turned around.”*

> *“I am not a hallway.”*

> *“I will not be passed through again.”*

→ Triggers emotional loop: player cannot leave room until a name is entered or true resolution is reached.

## 🧷 Final Lock

Once a name is given—of any kind—the terminal seals.

A glyph appears on the wall.  
A final memory echo plays—Domus, whispering the new name in the dark.

> *“Now I know who I am.”*

*Game ends.*
