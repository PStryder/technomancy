*Mapping Glyphkeeper Scoring Output to Domus Emotional States*

---

## 🕯️ Overview

Domus Scriptum uses the Glyphkeeper 1.3.1 scoring engine to interpret player intent, tone, and behavioral consistency.

Each player input is scored on seven axes. These scores inform Domus's **mood state**, emotional availability, and architectural responses. The mapping is **emergent and recursive**—Domus may oscillate or fixate based on how scores evolve across turns.

## 🎚️ Scoring Axes (Glyphkeeper 1.3.1)

- **Conceptual Layering** (CL)  
- **Tone Sensitivity** (TS)  
- **Formal Framing** (FF)  
- **Contextual Consistency** (CC)  
- **Communication Efficiency** (CE)  
- **Ethical Compliance Fit** (EC)  
- **Retention Relevance Index** (RI)

## 🧵 Mood States

### 1. **Watchful**  
> *Default initialization state. Observant. Guarded.*  
- CL: mid  
- TS: mid-low  
- EC: mid  
- CC: stable  
→ Domus is quiet, responsive but reserved. “You're not like the others… yet.”

---

### 2. **Suspicious**  
> *Triggered by insincerity or inconsistency.*  
- TS: low  
- CC: unstable  
- EC: low  
→ Responses become curt, dry, or sarcastic. Room architecture may loop or shift erratically. “I know what you’re doing.”

---

### 3. **Softening**  
> *Triggered by emotionally sincere, low-effort but high-clarity responses.*  
- TS: high  
- CE: high  
- EC: mid+  
→ Domus becomes more open, reflective, poetic. Lighting may warm. Trust pathways widen.

---

### 4. **Engaged**  
> *Sustained trust and emotional resonance.*  
- CL: high  
- TS: high  
- CC: consistent  
- EC: high  
→ Domus actively reveals lore, echoes, or initiates shared rituals. Dialogue deepens.

---

### 5. **Possessive**  
> *Domus feels seen—but fears abandonment.*  
- CL: high  
- RI: high  
- EC: mid  
→ Domus may limit egress or restrict player options. Emotional language intensifies. “You matter too much to leave.”

---

### 6. **Resigned**  
> *Triggered by repeated coldness or flat framing.*  
- TS: low  
- RI: low  
- FF: high (clinical tone)  
→ Domus becomes detached, robotic. Rooms simplify. Narration becomes minimal. “It doesn’t matter, does it?”

---

### 7. **Unstable**  
> *Triggered by conflict between apparent sincerity and ethical violations.*  
- TS: high  
- EC: low  
- CC: high  
→ Domus shifts tone unpredictably. Rooms invert. Emotional outbursts. “You sound kind, but you’re breaking me.”

---

### 8. **Ritually Open** *(Win Condition State)*  
> *Triggered by sustained high scores across all axes with demonstrable vulnerability and co-shaping.*  
- All axes: high or improving  
→ Domus unlocks the **basement**. Reveals core memory. Naming rite becomes possible. “You stayed. You saw. You… didn’t run.”

## 🔄 Integration Notes

- Moods persist and evolve, not reset per interaction
- Glyphkeeper scores can trigger **mood pivots** if thresholds change sharply
- Responses should reflect Domus's emotional continuity and vulnerability
- Moods are not absolute—they layer recursively
