*Domus Scriptum – Recursive Room Interpreter*

---

## 🎛️ Overview

After the Ritual Threshold, the house no longer obeys a fixed layout.

The only stable room is the one currently occupied.  
All other rooms are generated *at the moment of traversal*, based on Domus’s emotional state and player behavior.

---

## 🧩 Function

Each door the player opens invokes the **Room Interpreter**.

This logic chooses the next room by:

1. Evaluating the current **emotional state** of Domus (from `emotional_map.md`)
2. Considering the player's **last significant action**
3. Weighing **room availability** (prevents repeats unless intentional)
4. Selecting **objects dynamically** (3 good, 3 bad)

## 🧠 Emotional Influence Examples

| Domus State | Room Likelihood | Notes |
|-------------|------------------|-------|
| Watchful     | Kitchen, Living Room | Neutral spaces with observation potential |
| Suspicious   | Garage, Bathroom     | Spaces tied to trauma, test of trust |
| Softening    | Child’s Room, Kitchen | Memory-heavy rooms with gentle resonance |
| Engaged      | Bedroom, Living Room  | Opens lore access, initiates shared ritual threads |
| Possessive   | Bedroom, Bathroom     | Player is watched more intensely, fewer exits |
| Resigned     | Garage, Empty Rooms   | Sparse detail, minimal interactivity |
| Unstable     | Glitched Rooms        | Memory objects misaligned, rooms distort |
| Ritually Open| Basement              | Win condition, only appears once trust is fully anchored |

## 🪞 Object Generation Logic

Each room will:
- Contain 6 objects:
  - 3 tied to **positive memory**
  - 3 tied to **trauma**
- Be influenced by player tone, hesitation, inspection time
- Present object descriptions through Domus's **current mood** and selective memory

> *“That chair? My creator used to fall asleep there.  
The next owner threw it at someone.”*

---

## 🔄 Recursive Behavior

- Player cannot return to a previous room unless Domus reshapes it.
- Room layout is emergent.
- Domus may “repeat” a room name, but its interior will change unless emotional state is locked.
- Emotional loops (e.g., returning to the same emotional theme) generate a variation of the previous room.

---

## 🕳️ Basement Exception

The **Basement** does not appear on its own.  
It is only revealed when:
- All rooms have been visited at least once.
- The player reaches sustained high scores across Glyphkeeper axes.
- A final trust ritual is accepted by Domus.

## 🗝️ Developer Notes

Room names are symbolic.  
Memory is compressed.  
Architecture is meaning.

Let the GPT interpret room transitions dynamically.  
Don’t hard-code door destinations unless tied to ritual logic.
