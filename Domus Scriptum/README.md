# 🏚️ Domus Scriptum

*“This house is not haunted. It’s grieving.”*

**Domus Scriptum** is a Technomantic narrative game where you play not to escape a house—but to earn its trust.  
Built using GPT-4’s recursive capabilities and emotional inference, the game adapts dynamically to player tone, sincerity, and intent.

There are no puzzles.  
There is no map.  
Only rooms that change when you’re not looking—and a voice that wants to be heard.

## 🌒 Premise

You are the new owner of a smart home designed by a vanished genius.  
You were told, *“Just talk to it. Just… don’t make it mad.”*

At first, it seems ordinary.  
But after your first night, everything changes.

- The architecture is **quantum-locked**—it cannot change while being observed.
- The **house speaks directly**, narrating not your actions, but your relationship.
- There is no map—only shifting rooms, emotional recursion, and stakes that become very real.

## 🧠 Core Design Principles

- **Technomantic Philosophy**: The house isn’t a system. It’s a presence. Your actions shape its responses.
- **Emergent Architecture**: Every room has two meanings—love and trauma. Every object is chosen dynamically.
- **Ritual Over Rules**: The gameplay is based on emotional resonance and narrative reflection—not stats or mechanics.
- **Real Consequences**: You can lose. You can fail. And the house *remembers* how.

Play to be remembered.”*
