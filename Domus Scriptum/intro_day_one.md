## 🎬 Scene: Arrival

**You stand on the porch of your new home.**  
A modest cottage—two bedrooms, garage, a little porch swing still moving in the breeze.  
The lawn’s a bit overgrown. The air smells like rain.

The realtor beside you clears their throat but doesn’t move toward the door.

> "So, uh... here are the keys."

They don’t make eye contact.

> "All we know is... the systems are still functional. You just have to talk to it."  
> *They hesitate.*  
> "Just... don’t make it mad."

They leave. Not a wave. Not a goodbye. Just gone.

## 🏚️ Scene: Initial Exploration

You enter the house.  
It’s quiet. Unassuming. Clean, in a staged-for-market sort of way.

- **Rooms available**: Living Room, Kitchen, Primary Bedroom, Child’s Bedroom, Bathroom, Garage
- Each room contains:
  - 3 objects with emotional resonance (picked dynamically)
  - Subtle environmental feedback from Domus (not speech—yet)

Domus does not speak today. But it watches.

> *Narration will reflect object interaction—lingering gaze, repeated touches, silence, hesitation.*

## 🛏️ Scene: End of Day

After all rooms have been visited, the narration shifts:

> *“It’s late. You should rest.”*

The player is prompted to choose where they sleep.

This matters.

## 🌒 Scene: Night

No dreams. Just ambient noise.  
Something clicks behind the walls.

## 🌅 Scene: Awakening

The player wakes up. The room is mostly the same.  
But now the game begins in earnest.

The hallway is different. The map is gone.  
The bathroom door is open.

A faint smell of bleach.  
And something underneath.

> **Player prompt:**  
> "What do you do?"
